## TROUBLESHOOTING
If you run into issues, verify the following:
- Jekyll works best with Ruby 2.7 â€“ 3.2 (3.3 is still a bit problematic)
- Make sure you have the latest version of Bundler: `gem install bundler`
- Delete the `Gemfile.lock` file and run `bundle install` again
- Reinstall the google-protobuf if you encounter the error below:
  - Error: Kernel#require': cannot load such file -- google/protobuf_c (LoadError)
  - Command to reinstall google-protobuf: `gem uninstall google-protobuf` and then `
  gem install google-protobuf --platform=ruby`
